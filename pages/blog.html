        <h2 class="box-heading">About Technology</h2>
        <p class="box-text">Technology is a vital component of life in the modern world. People are so dependent on
          technology that they cannot live without it. Technology is important and useful in all areas of human life
          today. It has made life easy and comfortable by making communication and transport faster and easier
          (Harrington, 2011, p.35).

          It has made education accessible to all, and has improved healthcare services. Technology has made the world
          smaller and a better place to live. Without technology, fulfilling human needs would be a difficult task.
          Before advent of technology, human beings were still fulfilling their needs. However, with technology,
          fulfillment of needs became easier and faster.</p>

          make the daily management of enterprises more systematic, structured, and successful.

          Tech has boosted businesses by improving the hiring process, error-free collection and analysis of business
          data, and better communication with clients and partners.Advancements in tech have made it easier for more
          people to access the internet, resulting in online shopping being more popular now than ever.

          Currently, most people prefer to shop online without leaving the house because of its sheer convenience.

        <h2 class="box-heading">Negative Impact Of Technology</h2>
        <p class="box-text">The negative impacts of technology can include things like increased distraction and
          decreased
          face-to-face communication, as well as a greater potential for addiction and social isolation. First, people
          have
          become more anti-social because of change in methods of socializing (Harrington, 2008, p.103). Today, one does
          not
          need to interact physically with another person in order to establish a relationship.</p>
